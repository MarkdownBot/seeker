# Seeker

## Introduction

Seeker utilizes **HTML5, Javascript, JQuery and PHP** to grab **Device Information** and **GeoLocation** with High Accuracy.

Seeker Hosts a fake website on **Apache Server** and uses **Ngrok** to generate a SSL link which asks for Location Permission and if the user allows it, we can get :

-   Longitude
-   Latitude
-   Accuracy
-   Altitude - Not always available
-   Direction - Only available if user is moving
-   Speed - Only available if user is moving

Along with Location Information we can also get **Device Information** without any permissions :

-   Operating System
-   Platform
-   Number of CPU Cores
-   Amount of RAM - Approximate Results
-   Screen Resolution
-   GPU information
-   Browser Name and Version
-   Public IP Address

**This tool is purely a Proof of Concept and is for Educational Purposes Only, Seeker shows what data a malicious website can gather about you and your devices and why you should not click on random links and allow critical permissions such as Location etc.**

-   Other tools and services offer IP Geolocation which is not very accurate and does not give location of user.

-   Generally if a user accepts location permsission, Accuracy of the information recieved is **accurate to approximately 30 meters**.

**Note** : On iPhone due to some reason location accuracy is approximately 65 meters.
